### Hi there 👋

### About me

#### 👨🏼‍💻 I'm Thomas Murzyn a **Full stack developpeur**


😁 I enjoy coding and learning new things, I'm **autodidact**. 

💻 I create websites with **React js, Redux, Next js, Typescript and Tailwind Css** in Front end and **Node js, Express and Mongo db in Back end. I also like to use some cool stuff like **Graphql, Materia ui etc...

Outside the world of tech too, I love reading books of all types, watching some good movies or series and do arts martials and exercices.

I'm also a father 👨🏼‍🍼.

Take a look at my different _repositories_. I have a [portfolio website](https://thomas-murzyn-portfolio.vercel.app/) you can visit it an check my work for an other way.
